# Responsive-Image-in-Center
This is a code I have made for a website I am working on for a friend. The premise of this is for the image to stay in the middle of the page, but also have a responsive design for any device.

If you havent already, create a folder to put the index.html code in.
After this, create an image folder (I called mine img) and put the image you want to use in. 
Within the <body></body> where it shows the <img>, put your file name and what the file type is in the " src="" " for the image to show.
